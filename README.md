# Wee Backend Test

### Reference Documentation
The idea of this project is to measure how you evolve the code of this project.

We are not expecting a code that will make a rocket run, but something that will be used by our co workers on daily basis. We favor better and readable code than "super fast awesome solution".

You have 90minutes to do it, do not extend it. When the 90min ends, please send me a zip with your updates (keep your GIT data). Send me as well the URL of the repository. Some people tried to cheat on us by updating the history of GIT, that is why we ask both: ZIP and URL.

## What this project does
It is a REST api project that should allow the CRUD of shops.

## What you need to do here:

1) Make the project build and run. `./gradlew test`
1) Make the project build and run. `./gradlew bootRun`
1) Right now the endpoints are returning an empty Array (Shop#items), we should return items only if the items are present 
1) Create a report that will show the total of items per shop. Should return just a json with the data

## What we will evaluate
1) Your refactorings. Fell free to refactor everything
1) API bugs fixing
1) Your REST API design
1) Your REST API documentation - Swagger is already setup (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
1) Usage of git
1) Code design
